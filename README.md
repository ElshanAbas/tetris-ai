# Tetris Game

This repository contains a simple Tetris implementation that runs entirely in your web browser. It also includes a lightweight implementation of the **Codenames** word game in Azerbaijani.

## Running

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to play Tetris. Use the arrow keys to move and rotate the pieces. The game ends when the stack of pieces reaches the top of the board.

To try the Codenames demo, open `codenames.html` in a browser. Click on the cards to reveal their colors and use the **Casus baxışı** button to toggle the spymaster view.
